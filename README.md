# noisiq
noisiq is a visual quantum-circuit playground that lets you see noise in action. User's can inject, tune, and simulate errors as they propagate through the circuit over time.

------ In Development -------  
  1) Build the environment.
  2) 5-20 qubit simulations.
  3) Basic decoherence models like Pauli-gate errors, bit and phase flips errors and dampening.
  4) User editable noise "placement" and "type". 

------ Long term goals ------
  1) Explore a web-based app version.
  2) Build in more complex decoherence models.
  3) Explore the possibilty of QEC models. 
  4) Build decoherence models for specific qubit modalities. 
  5) Allow users to import circuits written in Qasm and Cirq.
